# Clara Network

**Clara Network** is an open-source project to design and build a
Mastercard/Visa-style card payment network end-to-end: scheme (network)
operator, issuer, and acquirer infrastructure.

## What's in this repository

The repo holds the **research and specification library** for the network under
[`docs/`](./docs/), plus the Go implementation of the switch and settlement
engine described in [`docs/25-clara-network-system-design.md`](./docs/25-clara-network-system-design.md),
and a **live web admin console** ([`web/`](./web/)) deployed to the cloud.

Start with [`docs/00-README.md`](./docs/00-README.md).

### Live demo (cloud)

A fully deployed, one-click sandbox is running:

- **Web console** — https://clara-network.vercel.app (Next.js on Vercel)
- **Admin API** — https://adminapi-production-efd2.up.railway.app (Go on Railway)
- **Database + Auth** — Supabase project `clara-network`

The database runs on Supabase's free plan, which pauses a project after 7 days
without activity. A paused project takes the whole demo down with it: the
database stops resolving, every Admin API data route returns a 500, and the
console has nothing to render. A daily
[`keepalive`](./.github/workflows/keepalive.yml) workflow pings the database and
the Admin API — both to reset that timer and to fail loudly if the demo dies,
so an outage surfaces as a failing workflow instead of rotting unnoticed. A paid
Supabase plan is the only hard guarantee, since paid projects cannot be paused.

Log in by picking a persona — no typing. See
[`web/README.md`](./web/README.md) for the full matrix and deploy runbook.

## Building & running

Phases 1–10 implement the **authorization flow, net settlement, scheme ledger,
issuing stack, acquiring stack, disputes engine, key management,
operational resilience, and an instant-payment layer**: acquirer → switch →
(risk check) → issuer authorization with BIN-based routing, failover,
idempotent replay, in-path risk scoring, stand-in processing; a clearing
engine that captures clearing files, computes per-member net positions,
enforces prefunded caps, applies the default fund, and emits ISO 20022
pacs.009 settlement instructions; an append-only double-entry ledger that
posts every net position as a balanced journal and reconciles the ledger
against the settlement agent's statement; the issuing stack — BIN ranges,
card personalization, EMV-style ARQC cryptogram verification (with ATC
anti-replay), token vault (PAN → token + PAR), and mobile-wallet provisioning;
the acquiring stack — merchant boarding with MATCH/OFAC negative-list
screening, MCC assignment with risk tiering, and a funding engine that
withholds processing fees and rolling reserves and schedules merchant payouts;
the disputes engine — a reason-code taxonomy, the file → representment →
rule → arbitration lifecycle with fees charged to the losing party, the
associated-transaction (prior-credit) check, SLA deadline tracking, and
merchant chargeback-ratio monitoring; the key-management layer — a
Hardware Security Module simulation with dual-control key ceremonies
(M-of-N), AES key wrap (RFC 3394), TR-31-style key blocks for transport to
members, ISO 9564 PIN blocks (formats 0 and 4) verified inside the HSM,
ISO 9797-1 retail MACs with tamper detection, key rotation, a full audit
trail, and dual-control zeroize; the resilience layer — issuer stand-in
processing (SIP/STIP) with per-issuer limits and negative/valid-card files,
per-route circuit breakers with half-open probing (primary → secondary →
stand-in → decline), outcome metrics with approximate p99 latency, and
burst detection of issuer-inoperative (91) responses that flags an issuer
outage; and the instant-payment layer — ISO 20022 pacs.008 customer credit
transfers settled in real time, 24/7/365, against fully prefunded member
positions (the RTP model) with a 20-second scheme SLA, verify-and-reserve
settlement capacity checks, rejection reason codes (AC04/AC01/AG01/FF01),
SLA timeout handling with reservation release (NOAS), and pacs.002 status
reports. It requires Go 1.26+ and Docker Desktop (Linux containers enabled).

```sh
# unit + integration tests (run on Linux — Windows has AppLocker/Defender
# blocks on unsigned test binaries)
go test ./...

# or run tests inside a Linux container
docker build --target test -t clara-network-test .

# run the full stack using Docker (postgres, redis, switch, issuer-sim,
# acquirer-sim, clearing-sim, ledger-sim, cardsvc, card-sim, acquiring-sim,
# disputes-sim, hsm-sim, resilience-sim, instant-sim): 6 auth requests with BIN routing and a velocity rule that
# declines the 6th with response code 59, then a settlement cycle with a
# member default covered by the default fund, a clean ledger + reconciliation
# run, the issuing stack demo (cryptogram verify, tokenize, provision), the
# acquiring stack demo (boarding decisions, fee/reserve funding, reserve
# release), the disputes demo (representment rulings, arbitration,
# associated-transaction rejection, chargeback ratios), the HSM demo
# (key ceremonies, PIN verify, retail MAC + tamper detection, key rotation,
# audit trail, zeroize), the resilience demo (failover to a secondary
# issuer, circuit-breaker trip, stand-in approvals/declines, 91-burst alert,
# half-open probe recovery), and the instant-payments demo (pacs.008 in ->
# ACSC/RJCT out, prefunded positions, SLA timeout with reservation release,
# position conservation)

### Admin API

The Admin API is a read-only REST service (`:8083`) that queries the shared PostgreSQL
schema to power dashboards, reporting, and operational visibility.

```sh
# start the admin API (requires CLARA_PG_DSN)
go run ./cmd/adminapi

# Docker stack already includes it at http://localhost:18083
```

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe |
| `GET /api/v1/dashboard` | Summary counts (transactions, clearing, merchants, disputes, cards, tokens) |
| `GET /api/v1/transactions` | Switch transaction audit log (filterable by status, currency) |
| `GET /api/v1/clearing/cycles` | Clearing cycle list |
| `GET /api/v1/clearing/net-positions` | Per-member net positions |
| `GET /api/v1/settlement/instructions` | Settlement pacs.009 instructions |
| `GET /api/v1/settlement/prefunds` | Prefund account balances vs caps |
| `GET /api/v1/settlement/default-fund` | Default fund balance |
| `GET /api/v1/ledger/accounts` | Double-entry ledger accounts + computed balances |
| `GET /api/v1/ledger/journal-entries` | Journal entry lines for each account |
| `GET /api/v1/cards` | Issued cards (masked PAN, status, product, ATC) |
| `GET /api/v1/bin-ranges` | BIN range assignments |
| `GET /api/v1/tokens` | Network tokens (PAR, device, requestor) |
| `GET /api/v1/merchants` | Boarded merchants (MCC, risk tier, reserves, limits) |

| `GET /api/v1/disputes/chargeback-ratio` | Chargeback ratio by merchant |

Key config (via env):

- `CLARA_ISSUER_ROUTES` — JSON `{receiving-institution-id:
  host:port}`; a value may be a comma-separated failover list.
- `CLARA_BIN_TABLE` — JSON `{"entries":{"400000":"1000001000"}}` routes by
  PAN BIN when the message omits DE100.
- `CLARA_RISK_RULES` — JSON rule set; velocity counters (per card / per
  merchant) are counted in Redis and can decline with a configurable code.
- `CLARA_REDIS_ADDR` — idempotency + risk counters.
- `CLARA_PG_DSN` — audit log, clearing records, net positions, prefund
  accounts, default fund.
- `CLARA_SEND_DE100=false` (acquirer-sim) — omit DE100 to exercise BIN routing.
- `CLARA_SCENARIO` (clearing-sim) — `default` (prefund covers) or `default`
  run with a member default; settlement pacs.009 XML is written to
  `CLARA_OUT` (default `out/clearing`).
- `CLARA_MISMATCH` (ledger-sim) — when set, corrupts the settlement agent's
  statement to demonstrate reconciliation classification (amount mismatch and
  orphan-in-ledger).
- `CLARA_ISSUER_MASTER_KEY` (cardsvc/card-sim) — 16-byte AES master key for
  per-card key derivation and cryptogram verification.
- `CLARA_BIN`, `CLARA_PAN`, `CLARA_PRODUCT` (cardsvc/card-sim) — issued BIN
  range and the PAN to personalize; `CLARA_DEVICE_ID`, `CLARA_TRID` for
  wallet provisioning.
- `CLARA_LISTEN` (cardsvc) — HTTP listen address (default `:8081`); the REST
  API exposes `POST /cards`, `POST /cards/{ref}/arqc`,
  `POST /cards/{ref}/verify-arqc`, `POST /tokens`, `GET /tokens/{token}`,
  `POST /tokens/{token}/provision`.
- `CLARA_PG_DSN` (acquiring-sim) — persists merchants, funding lines, and the
  MATCH/OFAC screening lists; without it the demo uses an in-memory store.
- `CLARA_PG_DSN` (disputes-sim) — persists dispute cases and monitored
  transactions; without it the demo uses an in-memory store.
- `CLARA_PG_DSN` (hsm-sim) — not used; the HSM simulation is fully in-process
  (keys, ceremonies, and the audit trail live inside the HSM and are wiped on
  exit or via a dual-control `Zeroize`).
- `CLARA_PG_DSN` (resilience-sim) — not used; the chaos drill runs fully
  in-process: a switch fronts a primary and a secondary issuer on localhost,
  then the primary dies (circuit breaker trips, traffic fails over), the
  secondary dies too (stand-in approves within limits, declines hot cards and
  restricted BINs, and issues 91s that trip a burst alert), and finally the
  primary recovers (a half-open probe re-closes the circuit).
- `CLARA_PG_DSN` (instant-sim) — not used; the instant-payment demo runs fully
  in-process: pacs.008 credit transfers settle in real time against
  prefunded positions with a 20-second SLA, and rejections (AC04/AC01/AG01/
  FF01/NOAS) never move funds. The SLA shown for the timeout drill is
  configurable (`CLARA_INSTANT_SLA`, default `3s`) so the drill does not wait
  twenty seconds.

### Web admin console

A read-only Next.js dashboard (`web/`) sits on top of the Admin API. It uses a
BFF (`/api/data/*`) that authenticates the user via Supabase, enforces a
role allow-list, and proxies to the Go `adminapi`. Hosting is CLI-only:
Next.js on **Vercel**, PostgreSQL + Auth on **Supabase**, and the Go
`adminapi` on **Railway**.

To try it, open the live console and pick a persona:

```
https://clara-network.vercel.app/login
```

The login screen is a persona dropdown — choose **Scheme Operator**, **Issuer**,
**Acquirer**, **Merchant**, or **Viewer** and it signs you in immediately with
that role's demo credentials (common password `ClaraDemo!2026`, provisioned by
`npm run db:users`). See [`web/README.md`](./web/README.md) for the demo matrix,
local setup, and the full cloud deploy runbook.

### Smoke testing

`make smoke` (or `scripts/smoke.sh`) is a one-click end-to-end smoke test that
boots the full docker-compose stack, seeds data, and verifies all three tiers
against live services — the PostgreSQL schema + seed rows, every `adminapi`
endpoint, and the frontend (a production `next build` plus runtime probes of
the auth middleware and the BFF auth guard). It prints a PASS/FAIL table and
exits non-zero on any failure. See [`docs/smoke-testing.md`](./docs/smoke-testing.md).

## Status

Research & specification library (docs 00–27), phase 1 (ISO 8583 switch),
phase 2 (authorization flow with BIN routing, risk, failover), phase 3
(clearing + net settlement with prefunding, default fund, pacs.009), phase 4
(append-only double-entry ledger + reconciliation against the settlement
statement), phase 5 (issuing stack: BIN ranges, card personalization, EMV ARQC
verification, token vault, wallet provisioning), phase 6 (acquiring stack:
merchant boarding with MATCH/OFAC screening, MCC risk tiering, fee/reserve
funding), phase 7 (disputes engine: reason codes, representment,
arbitration, associated-transaction check, chargeback monitoring), phase 8
(key management & security: HSM simulation, dual-control key ceremonies, AES
key wrap, PIN blocks, retail MACs, key rotation, audit, zeroize), phase 9
(operational resilience: stand-in processing with per-issuer limits and
negative/valid-card files, per-route circuit breakers with half-open probing,
outcome metrics and p99 latency, 91-burst outage detection, and a chaos
drill), and phase 10 (instant payments: ISO 20022 pacs.008 customer credit
transfers settled in real time, 24/7/365, against fully prefunded member
positions with a 20-second SLA, verify-and-reserve settlement capacity
checks, rejection reason codes, SLA timeout handling with reservation
release, and pacs.002 status reports) implemented. All ten blueprint phases
are complete. The Admin API (read-only REST at `:8083`) provides full
operational visibility across all services: transactions, clearing,
settlement, ledger, cards, tokens, merchants, and disputes — ready for
connecting dashboards and monitoring tools.

A **web admin console** (`web/`) is built and deployed to the cloud (Vercel +
Supabase + Railway) with a one-click persona login, and `make smoke` verifies
the full stack end to end.

**v0.1.0-beta** — all ten blueprint phases are implemented, `make smoke`
verifies the stack end to end, and the demo is live at
https://clara-network.vercel.app. No load or capacity testing has been run, so
treat the deployment as a functional sandbox rather than a capacity claim.
Contributions are welcome.
